## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- I initiated the planning phase by creating a quick mind map, capturing all the desired functionalities and styling elements for my final project.
- Next, I compiled a list of additional features to incorporate if time permitted, resulting in the mind map attached below.
- Once the planning was complete, I dived into the development process, ensuring that the project's functionality aligned precisely with my vision before proceeding to implement styling and design elements, including the creation of a logo.
- Throughout the development journey, the project underwent iterations and refinements, evolving into its current form through continuous problem-solving and adaptation.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- This project leverages the power of Semantic HTML, CSS, and Python to create a dynamic and visually appealing user experience.
- The implementation of Flask, psycopg2-binary, bcrypt, python-dotenv, requests, and gunicorn further enhances the functionality and performance of the project.
- Whether users are on the job search or looking to hire, this project provides an array of features. Job seekers can seamlessly browse, search with filters, view detailed listings, apply to positions, save favorites, and report any concerns. On the other hand, employers have the ability to effortlessly post job listings, make edits as needed, and remove listings when filled.
- To ensure a personalised experience, the project incorporates a feature that allows logged-in users to track their interactions and activities. This valuable information is securely accessible only through the user's unique login details, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Improve CSS (inc. classes & ids)
- Make HTML more Semantic 
- Refactor Python 

## :sob: Lessons learnt
Looking back on the development process, there are valuable lessons learned and areas where I would make improvements if given the opportunity to start over. One major aspect I would address is the choice of the job search engine API. In hindsight, I realised that the API I ultimately selected had limited functionality, hindering the full realisation of my original vision for the website. If I could go back, I would invest more time in finding a more robust and feature-rich job search engine API. By doing so, I could have created a platform with a larger database of real jobs, providing users with a more authentic and comprehensive job search experience. This change would have aligned the website more closely with my initial intentions and enhanced its overall value to users.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Better CSS
- Place to view all posted jobs by current user
- Option to remove saved jobs, unapply and clear certain or all history
- Add a search history memory to the search bar for frequent searches
- Make a profile and attatch a resume to be "sent" to the job owner/poster when applying for a job
- View others profiles and send friend request, private messages, job listings
